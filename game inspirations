  I had a simple idea for a game which basically scrapes either twitter or some other list of quotes and asks who said the quote, (eg. "who said it, dumbledore or socrates?")

  could also do something like the sports heads games?

Ming:
I prefer to do a rogue and pixel game. And this is a link(https://yq.chillyroom.com/da) access to a game called soul knight, and there are some interesting game videos. It is a popular and cool game, with magic
and weapon system. As for me, I wish we can resolve together to make a great game which can be inserted into our resumes.
