Ming: Hello my friends. To learn processing, I highly recommand u guys to learn libraries and java grammar from several ways: chatgpt, github projects and official documentation, any social media.
1. looking official documentation to start write some simple demo (website address:https://processing.org/reference)
2. looking some tutorials from social media: utube, bilibili(https://www.bilibili.tv/en)
3. ask chatgpt for more details about ur need and certain library.
4. looking others project directly from github(search with keywords:processing and game)

The purpose of making this file is to share github projects which u think might be useful to our game.
